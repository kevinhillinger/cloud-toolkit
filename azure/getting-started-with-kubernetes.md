# Kubernetes On Azure

Here are instructions on how to kickstart your work with Kubernetes on Azure. The information here will help get your local environment environment setup with all the necessary tools.

## Before using Azure

To use Azure, you're going to need the following prerequisites:

* An Azure Subscription 
* Owner access (either for the subscription or a resource group)

# Tools

## 1. Azure CLI

[Source documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

_NOTE: The CLI will give you access to the acs and kubernetes (managed) sub-commands._

### macOS
Installing the CLI is as simple as:

```
brew update && brew install azure-cli
```

If you don't have Brew, [install homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation.html).

### Windows
For Windows users, go to the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest) and follow the instructions for installing through an MSI.

## 2. ACS Engine

Source: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine) 

  > _TIP:_ The Azure Container Service Engine (acs-engine generates ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates for Docker enabled clusters on Microsoft Azure with your choice of DCOS, Kubernetes, or Swarm orchestrators. 

### Installation

https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/releases/download/v0.12.5/acs-engine-v0.12.5-darwin-amd64.tar.gz

#### macOS

1. Download the release
2. move it to your local optional install path
3. and make it available through bin

The script is below:

```
curl -L https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/releases/download/v0.12.5/acs-engine-v0.12.5-darwin-amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
mv acs-engine-v0.12.5-darwin-amd64/ /usr/local/opt/acs-engine/
sudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/acs-engine/acs-engine /usr/local/bin/acs-engine
```

Confirm that acs-engine is installed:

```
acs-engine version
```

#### Windows

1. First, go to the [acs-engine release](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/releases) on GitHub and download the Windows specific zip.
2. Next, unzip it and put the contents in `"C:\ProgramData\acs-engine"`
3. Update your PATH environment variable to include the install location
4. open a PowerShell console and type `acs-engine version` to confirm installation

## 3. kubectl

It's the assumption that you already are using Kubernetes. If not, you're going to need to install `kubectl'. To do this, either follow
the instructions in [the official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) or, after installing
the Azure CLI, execute the following command:

```
az acs kubernetes install-cli
```
